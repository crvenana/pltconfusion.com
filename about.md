Hi. My name is Nikica [^1]

I'm curious by nature and this page is where stuff that peaks my curiosity will end up.
Knowing myself, that stuff will probably be computer science related, but other topics may creep in.

If you want to know more, you can look me up on various social networks (links below).

Also, you can email me at \{\{ my_twitter_handle }} @ gmail.com

[^1]: pronounced Neekeetza for those of you that are thinking: "How do I pronounce these slavic names?!"
